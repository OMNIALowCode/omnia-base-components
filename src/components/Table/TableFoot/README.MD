# Table Foot Component Documentation

# Description

Component that renders a table footer.

This component is used as a child of the [Table](../../Table/) and acts as a container for other components. By default it renders table options using other components, such as an option to add new records of a given type, or pagination controls when the table is only used for visualization.

The table body is composed by a [TableRow](../TableRow/) component, that contains itself a number of other components.
